# CREATE LOCAL API AND GET DATAS FROM IONIC APP - EXAMPLE

## PART 1 : API implementation
Create API with using php is nothing more than returning data as JSON objects.
That datas can be retrieved from a database like MySQL or others.
In our case, I returned datas created directly in the php script, but not stored in any DB.

## Prerequisites
Just make sure you have a local Web Server running on your computer.

## Programming language used
PHP.

## How to run it ?
- Download this repository
- Create a folder and rename it 'local-api' inside your local webserver folder
- Move all files downloaded to the locap-api folder
- Open your web browser and past the following link in the search bar [http://localhost/local-api/coders.php](http://localhost/local-api/coders.php)
- If you get something like [this](screenshots/simple.png) or [this](screenshots/with-json-viewer.png), it's fine ! 


## PS 
I'm using Ubuntu and my local webserver folder is /var/www/html. On Windows, I think it's C:\wamp\www if you're using Wamp.
If you're using something else like laragon, read it's official doc.
