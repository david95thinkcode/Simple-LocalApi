# CREATE LOCAL API AND GET DATAS FROM IONIC APP - EXAMPLE

Creating API with using php is just returning data as JSON objects.
That datas can be retrieved from a database like MySQL and others.
In our case, I just return datas created but not stored in any DB.
I don't really know if you're familiar with Angular but the way I got in Ionic app is the same if you're just using Angular JS.
